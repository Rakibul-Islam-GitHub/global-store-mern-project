### What I learned
The main objective of this project was to gain experience working with `MERN STACK`. For client side implementation, `react` was used and `nodejs` & `expressjs` were used for building the backend. `REST api` method is used for passing data between client & server side. The project was running successfully and i lerned a lot building this project.
